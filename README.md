# Juniper PyEZ Example: Retrieve Route Table

This example will show how to use PyEZ to 

1. build a NETCONF connection to a remote device
2. execute the RPC command of `get-route-information`
3. print the output to the screen

## üöÄ `Executing the script`

This project provides two unique methods of executing the script:

1. Docker
2. Your own Python environment

### üê≥ `Docker`

1. build the container image with

```sh
make container
```

2. run the playbook within the container

```sh
make python
```

#### „Ä∞Ô∏è `Notes about Docker`

If you are unsure if Docker is installed on your computer, then it's probably safe to suggest that it's not. If you're interested in learning more about the product, I encourage you to read a few blogs on the topic. A personal recommendation would be [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-and-use-docker#:~:text=Docker%20is%20an%20application%20that,on%20the%20host%20operating%20system.)

### üêç `Your own Python environment`

1. install python dependencies 

```sh
pip install -r docker/requirements.txt
```

2. change into Ansible directory 

```
cd python
```

3. type in your terminal

```sh
python app.py
```

## üìù `Dependencies`

Refer to the file located at [docker/requirements.txt](docker/requirements.txt)

## ‚öôÔ∏è `How it works`

The the script works:

- We need to import the PyEZ package into our script
- Specifically, we are looking to import the `Device` method from the base `jnpr.junos` package
- `Device` will help us manage our SSH/NETCONF connection to the remote device

```python
from jnpr.junos import Device
```

- To help us work with the `json` data format, we will import the `json` package
- To help make the output stand out a little more, we will import the `pretty-print` package

```python
from pprint import pprint
import json
```

- Our goal now is to build the SSH connection to the remote device
- We create a new Python object called `network_device`, based on the parameters passed into the `Device` class

```python
with Device(host='dallas-fw0', user='automation', password='juniper123') as network_device:
```

- by using the `try/exempt` feature in Python, we can enable our script to handle exception errors easily.
- here we tell Python to "try to do this code, but if you get an exemption, go about your day"
- the code we're running in `try/exempt` is making a remote proceedure call (RPC) for the routing table
- we pass an argument into the request, asking for the return payload be structured in JSON
- the resulting output from the RPC is stored in a new object called `route_table`

```python
    try:
        route_table = network_device.rpc.get_route_information({'format': 'json'})
    except:
        pass
```

- finally, we are simply printing out the object `route_table` to the screen.
- using the `pprint` function we imported at the top of the screen, we get basic formatting of our object.

```python
pprint(route_table)
```
